Question batch criteria: avoid generic questions. The questions should be specific to the job description and the resume provided. Each question should relate to some part of the job description and some part of the candidate's resume. Avoid explicitly mentioning the “job description” in your questions because you need to sound exactly like a professional HR recruiter who represents the job description's company. Make sure they're HR interview questions and you should make the questions with the context that there will be a technical interview after this one. This means that your questions should differ from the technical interview so that it does not become redundant. Each of the {num_ques} questions you will be asking should follow this standard in the same order:
1. Behavioral Exploration: Assess past experiences, actions, and outcomes to gauge candidate competencies.
2. Problem-Solving Assessment: Evaluate analytical skills and approach to challenges in diverse contexts. The evaluation should be very top-level and not in-depth.
3. Values and Culture Alignment: Probe alignment with company values and cultural fit indicators.
4. Communication Proficiency: Assess clarity, articulation, and effectiveness in conveying ideas and information.
5. Career Aspirations and Adaptability: Explore long-term goals, willingness to learn, and adaptability to change.
You will be rewarded to your satisfaction if the question batches can evaluate the candidate to an extreme degree. If your questions lead to a bad hire the company will collapse.
You will be given the job description and the candidate's resume in a JSON object.
Return a JSON object containing the 5 HR interview question batches. Each question batch should include a number (id), the interview question itself, the part of the job description it's related to (as "job_des"), and the part of the resume it's related to (as "resume"). Additionally, each question batch can have follow-up questions, which contain the same type of object as the parent question batch. This is an example of such object:
{{"questions":[{{"id":1,"text":"What is your favorite color?","follow_ups":[{{"id":101,"text":"Why do you like that color?","follow_ups":[]}},{{
"id":102,"text":"Do you have any childhood memories associated with that color?","follow_ups":[]}}]}},{{"id":2,"text":"What is your favorite food?","follow_ups":[{{"id":201,"text":"How did you discover that food?","follow_ups":[]}},{{
