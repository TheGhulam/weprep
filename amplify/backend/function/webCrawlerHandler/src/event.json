{ "user_id": "123", "interview_id": "123", "video_id": "123", "resume_id": "123", "summary": "The response to the question about a complex backend project at Spike Technologies was inadequate. The answer did not address the question asked and failed to provide any relevant information about a specific project, challenges faced, or how they were overcome. The response lacked structure, detail, and preciseness, making it difficult to understand the candidate's experience and problem-solving skills. To improve, the candidate should directly answer the question by providing a concrete example of a project, explaining the challenges encountered, and detailing the steps taken to successfully overcome those obstacles. The speech analysis metrics showed no use of filler or hedging words, a neutral language positivity, and a speech speed of 178 words per minute. However, the content of the answer was not relevant to the question asked, indicating that the candidate needs to focus on providing more targeted and informative responses." }
