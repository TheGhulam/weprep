# Video Analysis Platform
Welcome to the repository for our video analysis platform! This platform combines a Next.js frontend with a serverless backend built using AWS services such as Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and more. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing videos, while the backend handles the processing and storage of video data.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend

Next.js: Our frontend is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering, efficient client-side navigation, and easy API integration.

### Backend

- AWS Lambda: We leverage AWS Lambda for serverless compute power, allowing us to process videos and perform analysis without managing servers.
- Amazon DynamoDB: DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service, is used to store and retrieve video metadata and analysis results efficiently.
- Amazon S3: We utilize Amazon S3 for secure and scalable storage of uploaded video files.
- Amazon Transcribe: Amazon Transcribe is employed to convert speech to text, enabling us to extract valuable insights from video audio.
- Amazon Polly: We use Amazon Polly to generate high-quality speech output, enhancing the user experience.
- Amazon Rekognition: Amazon Rekognition powers our video analysis capabilities, allowing us to detect objects, faces, and more within the uploaded videos.
- Amazon SNS: Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is utilized to send notifications and trigger asynchronous processing of videos.
- AWS Step Functions: We leverage AWS Step Functions to orchestrate and coordinate the various serverless components involved in video processing.
- Amazon API Gateway: API Gateway acts as the entry point for frontend requests, securely exposing our backend APIs.
- AWS Amplify: We use AWS Amplify to simplify the deployment and management of our frontend and backend services.
- AWS CodePipeline: CodePipeline is employed for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) of our application.
