# Video Analysis Backend

Welcome to the backend repository for our video analysis platform! This serverless backend is built using Python 3.8, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB to provide a scalable and efficient infrastructure for analyzing user-uploaded videos.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8:** Our backend is powered by Python 3.8, leveraging its versatility and rich ecosystem for developing serverless functions.

- **AWS Lambda:** We embrace serverless architecture to handle video processing tasks. AWS Lambda enables automatic scaling and efficient execution without the need for manual infrastructure management.

- **Amazon DynamoDB:** For seamless data storage, we utilize Amazon DynamoDB, a fully managed NoSQL database service. It ensures low-latency access to user data and analysis results.

## Features

- **Video Upload:** Users can securely upload their videos through our platform.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Leverage powerful machine learning models hosted on AWS Lambda to perform in-depth analysis of uploaded videos.

- **Scalability:** The serverless architecture allows our backend to scale effortlessly, accommodating varying workloads based on demand.

- **Security:** Our backend implements robust security measures, including encryption of data at rest and in transit, and strict access controls.
